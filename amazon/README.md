Notes after implementation:
- OrderItem can be separated from product, as product can be changed (name, price, etc). Keep a reference to original Product in OrderItem.
- Cancel order should trigger refund as well. Payment Method can be stored with order, and refund can be initiated on the same method.
- No need of order or cart manager. User can manage both orders and cart.
